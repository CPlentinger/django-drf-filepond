Installation
============

The app can be installed from PyPi::

	pip install django-drf-filepond

or add it to your list of dependencies in a *requirements.txt* file.

Configuration
-------------

There are three key configuration updates to make within your Django 
application to set up django-drf-filepond:

1. Add the app to INSTALLED_APPS:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add 'django-drf-filepond' to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your Django settings 
file (e.g. ``settings.py``)::

	...
	
	INSTALLED_APPS = [
		...,
		'django_drf_filepond'
	]
	
	...

You will need to re-run ``python manage.py migrate`` to update the database 
with the table(s) used by django-drf-filepond.

2. Set the temporary file upload location:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the location where you want django-drf-filepond to store temporary 
file uploads by adding the ``DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_UPLOAD_TMP`` configuration 
variable to your settings file, e.g.::

	import os
	...
	DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_UPLOAD_TMP = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'filepond-temp-uploads')
	...

.. note:: It is strongly recommended that you set 
	``DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_UPLOAD_TMP``. If you do not set this variable, the 
	app will set a default location for the storage of temporary uploads. 
	This is ``BASE_DIR/filepond_uploads`` where ``BASE_DIR`` is the variable 
	defined by default in an auto-generated Django settings file pointing to 
	the top-level directory of your Django project. If your settings do not 
	contain ``BASE_DIR`` the app will default to storing the 
	``filepond_uploads`` directory in the ``django-drf-filepond`` app  
	directory, wherever that is located. Note that this may be within the  
	``lib`` directory of a virtualenv.

3. Include the app urls into your main url configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the URL mappings for django-drf-filepond to your URL configuration 
in ``urls.py``::

	from django.conf.urls import url, include
	
	urlpatterns = [
		...
		url(r'^fp/', include('django_drf_filepond.urls')),
	]

On the client side, you need to set the endpoints of the ``process``, 
``revert``, ``fetch``, ``load`` and ``restore`` functions to match the 
endpoint used in your path statement above. For example if the first 
parameter to ``url`` is ``^fp/`` then the endpoint for the ``process`` 
function will be ``/fp/process/``.

(Optional) 4. Set the permanent file store location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you wish to let django-drf-filepond manage the permanent storage of file 
uploads (note that this is required if you wish to use the load method), 
you need to set ``DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_FILE_STORE_PATH`` in your application 
settings file, e.g.::

	...
	DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_FILE_STORE_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'stored_uploads')
	...


Advanced Configuration Options
------------------------------

There are some optional additional configuration parameters that can be used 
to manage other features of the library. These are detailed in this section.

``DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_DELETE_UPLOAD_TMP_DIRS`` (*default*: ``True``):

	When a file is uploaded from a client using *filepond*, or pulled from a 
	remote URL as a result of a call to the fetch endpoint from the filepond 
	client, a temporary directory is created for the uploaded/fetched file  
	to be placed into as a temporary upload. When the temporary upload is 
	subsequently removed, either because it is cancelled or because it is 
	moved to permanent storage, the file stored as a temporary upload is 
	removed along with the temporary directory that it is stored in. The 
	approach of creating a temporary directory named with a unique ID 
	specific to the individual file being uploaded is as described in the 
	`filepond server documentation <https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/patterns/api/server/#process>`_.
	
	In cases where there are large numbers of temporary uploads being 
	created and removed, if there is a need to reduce the load on the 
	filesystem, setting ``DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_DELETE_UPLOAD_TMP_DIRS`` to 
	``False`` will prevent the temporary directories from being removed when 
	a temporary upload is deleted. The files within those directories will 
	still be removed.
	
	*NOTE:* If you set ``DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_DELETE_UPLOAD_TMP_DIRS`` to   
	``False``, you will need to have some alternative periodic "garbage   
	collection" process in operation to remove all empty temporary   
	directories in order to avoid a build up of potentially very large   
	numbers of empty directories on the filesystem.
	   
Using a non-standard element name for your client-side filepond instance:

	If you have a filepond instance on your client web page that uses an  
	element name other than the default ``filepond``, *django-drf-filepond* 
	can now handle this. For example, if you have multiple filepond 
	instances on a page, you will need to give each instance a different 
	name. To take advatage of this feature, you will need to inject an   
	additional parameter ``fp_upload_field`` into the HTTP upload request 
	which provides the name of the filepond form instance to process. An 
	example of this is shown in the `issue <https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/django-drf-filepond/issues/4#issue-412361507>`_ 
	describing the request for this feature.   
	

Logging
-------

django-drf-filepond outputs a variety of debug logging messages. You can 
configure logging for the app through Django's `logging configuration <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/logging/>`_ in your 
Django `application settings <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/settings/>`_.

For example, taking a basic logging configuration such as the first example 
configuration in Django's `logging documentation examples <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/logging/#examples>`_, adding 
the following to the ``loggers`` section of the ``LOGGING`` configuration dictionary will 
enable DEBUG output for all modules in the ``django_drf_filepond`` package::

    'django_drf_filepond': {
        'handlers': ['file'],
        'level': 'DEBUG',
    },
    
You can also enable logging for individual modules or set different logging 
levels for different modules by specifying the fully qualified module name in 
the configuration, for example::

    'django_drf_filepond.views': {
        'handlers': ['file'],
        'level': 'DEBUG',
        'propagate': False,
    },
    'django_drf_filepond.models': {
        'handlers': ['file'],
        'level': 'INFO',
        'propagate': False,
    },
